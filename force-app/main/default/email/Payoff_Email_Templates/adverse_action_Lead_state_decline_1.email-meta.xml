    <textOnly>Hi {!genesis__Applications__c.Borrower_s_First_Name__c},



Thanks for applying for a Payoff Loan™, but at this time, we can’t approve your application.



Here at Payoff, we want you to understand the reasons why we cannot approve your application, so we listed all of the areas to focus on making improvements below. We’re still dedicated to helping you pay off your credit cards.



Additionally, we want you to have a clear understanding of your current credit score. Your credit score notice is attached as a PDF.



Reasons why you were not approved



1. Your credit score does not meet our minimum requirement, mainly due to:

Serious delinquency, and public record or collection filled
Number of accounts with delinquency
Time since delinquency is too recent or unknown
Too few accounts currently paid as agreed



2. Your credit report shows you’ve had more than 2 recent hard inquiries.

3. Your credit report shows you have been 90+ days late on an account, have had an account charged off, and/or have had a bankruptcy.

4. Our partner, TransUnion, is not returning information for us to make a credit  decision.

We’ve attached a more formal letter outlining all of the above and letting you know your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Your adverse action statement is attached as a PDF.

If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call at 1-800-878-0901.
