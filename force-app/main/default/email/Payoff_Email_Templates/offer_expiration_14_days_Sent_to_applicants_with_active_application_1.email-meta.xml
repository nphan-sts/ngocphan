    <textOnly>Hi {!genesis__Applications__c.Borrower_s_First_Name__c},



I wanted to reach out about your Payoff Loan application. Do you have any questions? You started it but never finished.


This is a friendly reminder that your application is only valid for 30 days and you currently have 14 days left until it expires. If it does expire, you&apos;ll miss out on all the savings that come with paying off your credit cards at a lower interest rate.



Continue my application



If we do not receive all requested information prior to the expiration date, the application will be incomplete and can not be further considered. If your application does expire, you may submit a new application to continue the process of becoming a member with Payoff.
